# TopVoxel datasets

This folder holds large TopVoxel dataset files that are not stored in git.

Download the datasets from the LRZ Sync+Share link:

- [LRZ Sync+Share download link](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiW6M69m5HoTUcH4T7wLKZ/)

Place the downloaded files in this `inputs` directory using exactly these filenames:

- `Molar.TopVoxel`
- `GEbracket.TopVoxel`
- `Femur.TopVoxel`

Note: `*.TopVoxel` files are ignored by `.gitignore` to keep the repository lightweight.
