NOTES
16-core parallelism with graph coloring. Massive dent in time taken per iter. If goal is to parallelize K_times_u without atomics/lock in y vectors we want to ensure that elements that share nodes are not processed in parallel (causing race conditions). You can do graph coloring to get around this (each element is a vertex, connectivity is determined by the nodes, and after coloring no element with a shared node should have the same color.) Each color is parallelized over.

Coloring is built in CreateVoxelFEAmodel_Cuboid.
Element coloring is done greedily in ElementColoring.
