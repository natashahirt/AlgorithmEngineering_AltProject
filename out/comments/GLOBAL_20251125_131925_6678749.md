objective last: 1.238886e+01

TIME
total solver time: 2.913590e+02

percentage time spent on cg: 99.58%
percentage time spent on optim: 0.42%
percentage time spent on filtering: 0.19%

NOTES
We added PDEFilterWorkspace and PCGFreeWorkspace so that ApplyPDEFilter and PCG_free, can, respectively, use pre-allocated vectors of pfull, Apfull, Apfree etc. instead of pulling and reassigning them each time. Does not make a significant dent in time per iteration (0.2s) but it is better than nothing and may reduce cache misses.
