NOTES
Fuesed loop compliance kernel without tmp[24], skip dead (null) elements, leave FEAKernelView overload intact. compute_compliance_kernel now computes ce via a single nested loop with an inner SIMD dot; no intermediate buffer. Also inlined the kernels and added aligned-assumpe on Kptr for GCC.
