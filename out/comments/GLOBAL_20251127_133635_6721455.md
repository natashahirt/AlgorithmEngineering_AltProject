NOTES
Added graph coloring for K_times_u_finest. This compilation doesn't support OpenMP so it was the single therad run. Did slow down, though not as much as I might have feared given the overhead of coloring the graph. Will test on multiple cores and then try to add a kernel that does single threading without coloring.
