NOTES
0..23 gather/scatter is changed from:

// gather
for (int a = 0; a < 8; ++a) {
    const int n = en[a];
    const int base = 3*a;
    ue[base + 0] = ux[n];
    ue[base + 1] = uy[n];
    ue[base + 2] = uz[n];
}

to:
for (int i = 0; i < 24; ++i) {
    const int a = node_of_i_[i];
    const int c = comp_of_i_[i];
    const int n = en[a];
    if      (c == 0) ue[i] = ux[n];
    else if (c == 1) ue[i] = uy[n];
    else             ue[i] = uz[n];
}

using node parity maps. Did make things meaningfully slower, likely because of added logical branching and a worse memory storage pattern. Reverting to previous.
