NOTES
Parallel Cholesky! Improving local kernels instead of trying to use Eigen by parallelizing the matrix solve. The parallel cholesky algorithm chol_spd_inplace uses a column-oriented solve that allows elements to be computed in parallel (dot products are performed on rows which are contiguous in memory and outer updates are distributed across threads). chol_solve_lower is augmented with SIMD vectorization derivatives in forward substitution and saxpy (column update) in backward substitution to reduce cache misses.
