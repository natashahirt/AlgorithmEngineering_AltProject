PARAMETERS
original dims: x=60, y=30, z=30
padded dims: x=64, y=32, z=32
v0: 0.12

SOLVING
iterations: 30
cg iterations: 800

RESULTS
compliance solid: 1.172298e+00
objective first: 6.780217e+02
objective last: 1.240235e+01

TIME
total solver time: 2.432068e+02
time per iter: 8.1404
percentage time spent on cg: 99.59%
percentage time spent on optim: 0.41%
percentage time spent on filtering: 0.15%

NOTES
Adding an overloaded pointer kernel for compute_compliance actually slowed things down. May have added some extra indirection because of the temp array/buffer.
