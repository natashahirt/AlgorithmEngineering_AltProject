RESULTS
compliance solid: 3.719154e+00
objective first: 2.15475651e+03
objective last: 5.26162376e-01

TIME
total solver time: 2.7564e+02
time per iter: 9.1880e+00
percentage time spent on cg: 9.9775e+01
percentage time spent on optim: 2.5280e-01
percentage time spent on filtering: 1.0270e-01

NOTES
Terrible, once again boundary conditions appear not to exist and we get a meaningless blob.
Time to hard fork back to the vanilla implementation and attempt a more robust, slower approach
toward implementing the features of the matlab script.
