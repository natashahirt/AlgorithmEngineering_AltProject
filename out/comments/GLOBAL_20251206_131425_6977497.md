NOTES
Pretty solid. Removed atomics in MG_BuildDiagonals and MGCoarsenDiagonal (use coloring from fea.cpp instead) and precomputed geometric template matrices ($T^T K_e T$) to replace 24^3 triple-matrix products in nsted loop with scaled addition. Did give a SIGNIFICANT speedup with respect to the one run just prior.
