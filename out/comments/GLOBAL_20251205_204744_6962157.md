NOTES
Multigrid optimization:
- stop logic that stops multigrid coarsening (keep coarsening until it cannot be coarsened further)
- LimitDOFs reduced from 200,000 to 2,000 so direct solver only runs on tiny grids
- parallelize dense matrix assembly loop in coarsest.cpp using OpenMP
- use MATLAB additive smoother to avoid K*x residual updates at each level
