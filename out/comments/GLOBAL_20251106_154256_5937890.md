objective last: 8.99888129e+01

TIME
total solver time: 4.3165e+00
time per iter: 1.4388e-01
percentage time spent on cg: 94.96%
percentage time spent on optim: 1.73%
percentage time spent on filtering: 0.72%

NOTES
Use true diagonal preconditioner instead of approximation based on row-sum (should reduce number of iterations).
Increases iteration speed slightly. We'll go back to the original.
