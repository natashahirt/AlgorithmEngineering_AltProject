PARAMETERS
dims: x=12, y=24, z=12
v0: 0.12

SOLVING
iterations: 30
cg iterations: 800

RESULTS
compliance solid: 3.283315e+00
objective first: 1.89835386e+03
objective last: 8.99888116e+01

TIME
total solver time: 3.8626e+00
time per iter: 1.2875e-01
percentage time spent on cg: 98.40%
percentage time spent on optim: 1.70%
percentage time spent on filtering: 0.64%

NOTES
Boundary condition multigrid Jacobi diagonal. After assembling `diag(K)` from `diag(Ke)*Ee` 
fixeed DOFs are set to 1.0. Better respects Dirichlet BCs. Running time completely identical to 
5937536, which makes sense since the change targets the filtering step.
