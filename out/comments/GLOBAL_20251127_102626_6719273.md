NOTES
Refactored K_times_u_finest to use a pointer-only kernel, which K_times_u_finest is now a wrapper for. Kernel gathers 24 DOFs, multiplies constant 24x24 Ke scaled by Ee, and scatters back to Y. Again using __restrict__ pointers to reduce aliasing. Ke uses 64-bit alignment (alignas(64) std::array<double,24*24> Ke{}; in core.hpp). Does a great job at dropping time spent per iteration!
