NOTES
- Fast stencil transfers in transfer.cpp (interpolation weights calculated on the fly in grid structure instead of lookups)
- preconditioner.cpp and transfers.cpp perform restriction step directly on strided residual vectors, reducing need to copy data to and fro temporary buffers for V-cycle
- prolongation uses faster stencil kernel
