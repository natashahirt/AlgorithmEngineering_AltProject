NOTES
Cuboid 30x60x30; STL saved to out/stl/GLOBAL_20251116_154803_6439818.stl.
Added preallocation for K_times_u_finest; precomputed element DoF locations with mesh.eDofMat; removed Dirichlet zeroing since K_times_u_finest already ensures fixed DoFs are zeroed.
Removed 30 seconds from total solver time and 0.12s per iteration.
