PARAMETERS
original dims: x=60, y=30, z=30
padded dims: x=64, y=32, z=32
v0: 0.12

SOLVING
iterations: 30
cg iterations: 800

RESULTS
compliance solid: 1.169420e+00
objective first: 6.766118e+02
objective last: 1.238525e+01

TIME
total solver time: 2.111746e+02
time per iter: 7.0810
percentage time spent on cg: 99.41%
percentage time spent on optim: 0.59%
percentage time spent on filtering: 0.26%

NOTES
Added true Jacobi preconditioner to conjugate gradient and it shaved off 2 seconds per optimization interation by reducing the number of CG iterations required to converge. Huge.
