PARAMETERS
original dims: x=60, y=30, z=30
padded dims: x=64, y=32, z=32
v0: 0.12

SOLVING
iterations: 30
cg iterations: 800

RESULTS
compliance solid: 1.172298e+00
objective first: 6.780217e+02
objective last: 1.240206e+01

TIME
total solver time: 2.168385e+02
time per iter: 7.2594
percentage time spent on cg: 99.57%
percentage time spent on optim: 0.43%
percentage time spent on filtering: 0.16%

NOTES
Went back to a float-double distribution. Not super successful but it did cut time down from full float comptuations by .2s.
