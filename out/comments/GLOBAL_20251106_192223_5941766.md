NOTES
Adaptive logic for multigrid. Instead of fixed five levels, coarsens resolution of grid by
span 4 if non-dyadic, and span of 2 afterward. If any coarse dimension exceeds dense factorization
limit or the dimension <1 (or matlab's "very small" dim-size-2 guard), then stop iterating.
Fastest solver speed so far, identical objective value.
