NOTES
Removed direct solution and replaced with prevous row-sum diagonal for the filter. Use a relative
stopping rule instead of the absolute. Implemented warm start conditional upon the proximity
of the previous RHS to the current.
The marginal increase in time doesn't warrant reverting back to 5927536 and is likely due to
noise. Will be useful for larger iterations.

Warm start means initializing the iterative solver for the filter with the solution from the
previous iteration (can speed up convergence if RHS has not changed much.)
